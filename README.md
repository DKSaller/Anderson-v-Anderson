Executive Summary
This is a project analyzing the filmographies of two directors, Paul Thomas Anderson and Wes Anderson. I’m looking at each of their movies and analyzing all represented data to see if there exists any correlation between their stats (imdb ratings/rotten tomatoes/box office) and the cast of his films and analyzing how many recurring stars he repeats working with.

Motivation
I love films by Paul Thomas Anderson and enjoy a good portion of the work of Wes Anderson. I’m curious to see how they measure up against each other as they both released their first features in the same year (1996) and are continuing to release films.  I’m also wondering how my favorites of theirs rank up compared to their other films.

Data Question
Which of their films are the highest rated and the highest grossing? Within that, are there any trends I will notice between cast members that lead to their films being successful? 

Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
The MVP will be a presentation of my work in Python which will combine API calling and potentially some web-scraping as well. After cleaning the data, I will then create the presentation using a combination of PowerBI and PowerPoint.

Schedule (through <April 25>)
1.	Get the Data (April 7)
2.	Clean & Explore the Data (April 14)
3.	Create Presentation of your Analysis (April 18)
-	Should be a presentation, but could include a Jupyter Notebook or dashboard in Excel, Tableau, or PowerBI
4.	Internal demos (April 18)
5.	Demo Day!! (April 25)

Data Sources
•	TMDb (The Movie Database) API https://www.themoviedb.org/
•	IMDb (Internation Movie Database) (for imdb score) https://github.com/cinemagoer/cinemagoer 
•	Rotten Tomatoes (for each of their films getting the critic, audience scores and box office) 
    https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/paul_thomas_anderson
•	https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/wes_anderson

Known Issues and Challenges
•	Combining the data from 3 separate sources could cause struggles when trying to merge the dataframes into one 
•	Figuring out whether api-calling or web-scraping will be more appropriate when acquiring my data
•	Figuring out how to make my dashboard presentation ready
