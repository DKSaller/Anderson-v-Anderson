# Anderson vs Anderson
My capstone project analyzing the data of the filmography of director Paul Thomas Anderson

This is a project taking in data from The Movie Database (TMDb), the International Movie Database (IMDb), and Rotten Tomatoes to look at the filmography of Paul Thomas Anderson. I'm looking specifically at the various ratings across the data sources, the actors present in each of his films, and the MPAA ratings.

This project uses a combination of Python to gather the data, examine it, and clean it; it also uses PowerBI to put all the data together to create a dashboard showing all the analyzed information. It will potentially use PowerPoint for a presentation and might incorporate more data of a peer of PTA in Wes Anderson.
